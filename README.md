# 1D-Localization
1D localization using Bayesian Filter to locate a robot in 1D space and represent uncertainty in robot motion

## The goal
A robot perceives the world through its "senses." For example, self-driving cars use video, radar, and Lidar, to observe the world around them. As cars gather data, they build up a 3D world of observations that tells the car where it is, where other objects (like trees, pedestrians, and other vehicles) are, and where it should be going!

To start basics from localization, this project is to learn 2D representation of the world for simplicity to solve more complex robot localization in 3D later.
